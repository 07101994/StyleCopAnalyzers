## Cause

A line of code ends with a space, tab, or other whitespace characters before the end of line character(s).

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when a line of code ends with any form of whitespace other than the end of line character(s). Extra whitespace can show up in editors with visible whitespace, or cause unnecessary code churn when developers format the document such that trailing whitespace is removed later. Some diff tools even highlight trailing whitespace to encourage developers to trim it.

## How to fix violations

The fix an instance of this violation, delete all excess whitespace characters at the end of the line.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1028 // No trailing whitespace
SomeMethodWithSpaceAfterTheSemicolon();    
#pragma warning restore SA1028 // No trailing whitespace
```
