## Cause

The operator keyword within a C# operator overload method is not followed by any whitespace.

## Rule Description

A violation of this rule occurs when the operator keyword within an operator overload method is not followed by any whitespace. The operator keyword should always be followed by a single space. For example:
    public MyClass operator +(MyClass a, MyClass b)
    {
    }



## How to Fix Violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add a single space after the operator keyword.

## How to Suppress Violations
